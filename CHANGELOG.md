## [0.1.11] - 2026-06-15

### Changed

- Relaxed bundled `tinybird` CLI dependency to `>=4.6.0,<4.7.0` to avoid resolution failures while keeping the SDK on the `4.6.x` line.
- Updated branch data config handling to use `branch_data_mode`; legacy `branch_data_on_create` now triggers an explicit migration error.
- `branch_data_mode` now only accepts `last_partition` as a user-facing value.
- In `dev_mode=local`, branch data mode warnings are now shown only when `branch_data_mode` is explicitly set in `tinybird.config.json`.
- `tinybird branch create` and `tinybird branch clear` now show a deprecation warning (instead of failing) when `--ignore-datasource` is passed, then continue by ignoring that flag.
